- 👋 Hi, I’m @vipx1
- 👀 I’m interested in Kali Linux with a Budgie desktop frontend. I end result is very it a nice and convient combination.
      It's one of those little projects I started as a lingering thought and then a few quick modifcations
      & now has pretty much taken over all my free time but I'm loving it. My latest "daily driver" laptop is a Dell XPS 
      Ubuntu Budgie, my first Budgie desktop installation & I really like it as, it seems, do many people who make the switch.
      My previous daily driver, Lenovo X1 carbon Thinkpad was just lying there so I __squashed in__ a few hardware mods & 
      installed Kali and then started tinkering. The Dell hasn't been switched on in weeks.
      
      🤔 I came in here to look for something, WTF was it now..
      
- 🌱 I’m currently learning new stuff every day because I love PC's & I'm always intrested in knowing more aboout how they work.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything but as metioned above, I do like budgie desktop.
- 📫 How to reach me, here, in github or Twitter @vipx1. 👍
